	<li>I got 4A 1B in Upsr</li>

	<li>I got a lots of wonderful memories at secondary school which i was surrounding with some great people around me which are my bestfriends and my teachers.  We still contacting each other until now. </li>
	<li>Not only that, all of the teacher at SMKDMPR2 that i know there are very kindhearted person.  They really treat all of their students kindly just like their own children.  How i miss all of them and all of the memories i had there.  I miss school. </li>

	<li>I also got a lots of wonderful memories at University which i have learned about so many things in life.  One of them is how to be take care of myself by my own at the university because my parents were not there.  </li>
	<li>Additionally, UiTM Dungun really gave me good vibes because whenever i feel stress about my assignments, or missing both of my parents and family, i can just go to the beach opposite of my university to release my stress.  I really miss UiTM Dungun and diploma life so much. </li>
	<li> And now i am still studying and focusing on my degree life.  I do not have a lot of memories in degree life due to pandemic covid-19.  All of the students have to stay at home and cannot go to university to study.  We just study through Online Distance Learning at home which i think is not efficient and difficult compared to physical class. I miss life before covid </li>
